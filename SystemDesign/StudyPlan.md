# Recommended Reading Order for Distributed Systems Papers

---

## **1. Foundational Principles**
Start with the basics to understand the core principles and challenges in distributed systems.

1. **End-to-End Arguments in System Design**  
   *Provides a foundational design principle for distributed systems.*  
   **Reason**: This will give you a strong theoretical foundation to understand why certain design decisions are made in distributed systems.

2. **Paxos: The Simple Consensus Algorithm**  
   *Consensus protocol for distributed systems.*  
   **Reason**: Paxos introduces consensus, a key concept in achieving consistency across distributed nodes.

3. **Raft: Consensus Protocol**  
   *Understandable consensus algorithm.*  
   **Reason**: Raft simplifies Paxos, making it easier to grasp the practical application of consensus in distributed systems.
